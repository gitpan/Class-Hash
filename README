Class::Hash version 1.01
========================

Sometimes its convenient to see a hash presented as an object with methods.
This module implements a "inside-out" hash that may be accessed via name
accessors or by method operations, depending upon how the instance is
configured.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Perl 5.8.0. Technically, it may work with slightly
earlier versions (no earlier than 5.7.1), but I haven't tested it with
anything else.
